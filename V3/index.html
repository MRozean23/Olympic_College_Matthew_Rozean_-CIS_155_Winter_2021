                                Hello this is a picture of my dog Jax, he is a French Bulldog. He was originally born in Bulgaria and his puppy name was <em> "Andijio" </em>. 
                                For a year he was living with a military family in Germany, about an hour away from where I was, at the time.
                                That family were the ones who renamed my dog Jax, but I was lucky to find him up for adoption! He's lived with me for over 2 years now 
                                and is the best sidekick I could have ever asked for! He's been on quite an adventure since I have gotten him, since I am in the 
                                Military he has traveled a lot with me. He's got to explore cities in Germany, and Poland. He moved to the states to New 
                                Hampshire and just recently completed a move to Washington State! I've learned so much about owning French Bulldogs and that's what 
                                made me create this site to help others learn about the breed to see if a French Bullgdog is right for you!
                            </p>

                                Here are some quick  and basic things I have come to find out myself by owning a French Bulldog.
                                <div> - They are medium sized dogs, most are around 20-35 pounds fully grown. </div> 
                                <div> - Dedication in training, they will learn but it takes time, must have patience and consistency when it comes to training them. </div>
                                <div> - Allergies during the Spring, my poor Jax had a bad breakout with bumps all over his skin and he needed to go to a vet for a shot. 
                                        Now that I'm aware of it I ensure to bathe him with a skin relief shampoo as soon as I see some irritation start to emerge. Not just 
                                        environmental allergies, my Jax could be a special case but he is allergic to beef, chicken and has to eat only seafood dog food. </div>
                                <div> - Exercising is very easy to maintain since they have what is called the “short muzzle”, the official name for it is brachycephalic, 
                                        which tends to make them breathe very loudly when they get their heart rate up. The “short muzzle” also makes them snore a lot! </div>
                                <div> - Their hair is very short and fine, but still shed a lot! And the little hairs they shed sometimes can stab your foot. But since it is 
                                        small and fine hair it is easy to clean up and very easy to wash and give them baths. </div>
                                <div> - A funny thing to be aware about that I’ve heard from people I know that own Frenchies is they are gassy! My Jax farts all the time and 
                                        I just find it hilarious!! </div>
                            </p>
