                                Welcome to my site! This was created as a project for my class in Web Development. We are challenged to create our own web page of
                                any content of our choosing! I chose to create a site about my French Bulldog Jax and provide any useful information needed about
                                French Bulldogs. For example how to nurture, health problems that may occur, even help you find potential adoption and breeder pages.
                                Now about the class, in our first week of instruction we learned Hyper Text Markup Languag (html) and how html is used to set up web 
                                pages. Then in the next week we learned abot Cascading Style Sheets also known as CSS. CSS is all about the design and style of the             
                                webpage, everything you need to make your website look good! More updates to come every 2 weeks!

                                <div> Version 2 Update </div>
                                The past few weeks we have been learning more advanced ways to syle your webpage, for example box shadows, making boxes
                                curved, image effects and background images. These updates were crucial to the design of the webpage itself and to make things look a lot
                                cleaner and smoother. Also it helped to add effects pleasing to the users eyes.

                                <div> Version 3 Update </div>
                                The last 2 weeks we have been going over and discussing Flexboxes and Tables. I personally wasn't a fan of the flexbox ideas
                                for my website so I mainly stuck with a tables design. I found it easier to control where I wanted my information on the screen
                                by using the table set up. The table give you access to build the amount of colums and rows you need on your page. 
                            </p>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
