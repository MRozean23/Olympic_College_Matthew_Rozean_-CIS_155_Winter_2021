                            Frenchies love being a couch potato but also love exercise and being with their human. They don't need much exercise 
                            to keep them healthy, as long as you're not over feeding them. Just an hour a day of either outside activity or a 
                            walk or just playing around with them in the house would suffice for their exercise. Make sure to take breaks when 
                            they start to pant or breathe heavy, again because of their short snouts.

                            Early exposure to people, dogs and places is always good for any dog and especially for French Bulldogs to help with 
                            their socialization skills. French Bulldogs can be stubborn but with the correct motivation and treats to ensure them 
                            of the things they do correctly they will learn and adapt!
