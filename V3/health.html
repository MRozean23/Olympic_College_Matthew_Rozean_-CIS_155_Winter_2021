                            French Bulldogs are prone to brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome or BOAS. This health problem is due to a 
                            short facial structure that creates a squashing effect of the tissues at the back of the nose and in the throat. 
                            Their flattened face makes it hard for them to pant and cool themselves down which can cause health issues. Some 
                            ways to prevent this is to exercise them moderately and use a harness when walking to prevent a collar from disrupting 
                            the airflow.  
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            Because of their flat faces their eyes stick out more compared to other dogs, leaving their eyes exposed to dangers 
                            and infections. Eye injuries can lead to these infections,  corneal ulcers and the most common for French Bulldogs  
                            <em>‘cherry eye’</em>, where eye tissue sticks out of the eye socket, iIt can affect one or both eyes and will require a trip 
                            to the vet.

                            Skin allergies are common for French Bulldogs and various things can irritate their skins and lead to skin inflammation. 
                            For example, things that they breathe in (like pollen or dust mites), items that they eat (for example, wheat), items 
                            that they come into contact with (for example, washing powders), or bites from parasites (such as fleas). Allergies 
                            cannot be cured but they can be treated, and like I said before there are things to help reduce the issue to ensure 
                            they stay happy and healthy.

                            French Bulldogs have very distinct ‘bat like’ ears that are essentially a target for bacterias, germs and debris to 
                            enter the ear canal. These all can lead to ear infections, keep a close eye on your dog if he/she starts scratching 
                            their ears a lot or the ears start to look more abnormally red then they should be, then seek immediate Veterinary 
                            assistance.

                            French Bulldogs are prone to issues with their spine and neck over other dogs, and this is the way they are bred such 
                            as short legs and a stout body frame. A mixture of issues ranging from back pain to slipped discs also known as 
                            intervertebral disc disease (IVDD). This occurs when the discs between the vertebrae become damaged and brittle with 
                            age or general wear and tear. This makes the discs prone to rupturing, slipping and pressing against the spinal cord 
                            itself. Treatment depends on the cause and location of the problem but may include medication, rest and possibly even 
                            surgery to help live a comfortable life.

                            French Bulldogs are more prone to issues and pain with their spine and neck than other dogs and this is a result 
                            of the way they are bred, the way their body has been developed. For example characteristics like shortened 
                            back legs, compared to their front legs. Their neck issues derive from them being structured heavy towards the front,
                            this also why French Bulldogs do not swim well and need to be monitored if they are around pools or bodies of water 
                            that they may accidentally fall into.
