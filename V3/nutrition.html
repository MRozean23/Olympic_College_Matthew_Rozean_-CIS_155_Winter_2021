                            It’s important to feed the correct food that matches the dogs age (Puppy, Adult or Senior). For the proper amount of food you can 
                            find the suggestions on the bag itself but 2 to 3 times a day is the ideal food intake for Frenchies. A lot of obesity issues arise 
                            in French Bulldogs due to the “Short Muzzle” I mentioned earlier. Keeping a dog in healthy weight and shape will lower the chances 
                            of them having any back, spine or hip issues. Make sure when you give them treats to do so in moderation, and give them treats that 
                            match their exercise levels, to prevent unhealthy weight gain.

                            <div> Water </div>
                            Frenchies need access to plenty of water, especially on hotter days than usual. Due to brachycephalic muzzles they can overheat 
                            easily. It would be very helpful to invest in a portable water source for Frenchie owners when you decide to go and take them out 
                            for a walk or just have some water accessible for them when they are outside exercising.

                        <td>
                            <div> Grooming </div>
                            Brushing weekly will do the trick as they shed constantly but it’s minimal hair that they shed. Brushing encourages new hair growth 
                            which then in return distributes hair oils throughout their skin keeping them looking healthy. Also ensure to clean out their lip 
                            folds and to be careful washing their faces and not get water to run into their eyes or ears. Lastly ensure to trim their nails so 
                            that long nails won’t cause them pain, you can do this by trimming them yourself or if you walk your dog on pavement you can 
                            naturally let the pavement trim their nails.
