        Welcome to my site! This was created as a project for my class in Web Development. We are challenged to create our own web page of
        any content of our choosing! I chose to create a site about my French Bulldog Jax and provide any useful information needed about
        French Bulldogs. For example how to nurture, health problems that may occur, even help you find potential adoption and breeder pages.
        Now about the class, in our first week of instruction we learned Hyper Text Markup Languag (html) and how html is used to set up web 
        pages. Then in the next week we learned abot Cascading Style Sheets also known as CSS. CSS is all about the design and style of the             webpage, everything you need to make your website look good!
